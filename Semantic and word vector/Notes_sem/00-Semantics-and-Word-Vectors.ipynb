    "Up to now we've used the occurrence of specific words and word patterns to perform test classifications. In this section we'll take machine learning even further, and try to extract intended meanings from complex phrases. Some simple examples include:\n",

    "* That was the worst movie I've ever seen.\n",

    "The way this is done is through complex machine learning algorithms like [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec). The idea is to create numerical arrays, or *word embeddings* for every word in a large corpus. Each word is assigned its own vector in such a way that words that frequently appear together in the same context are given vectors that are close together. The result is a model that may not know that a \"lion\" is an animal, but does know that \"lion\" is closer in context to \"cat\" than \"dandelion\".\n",
